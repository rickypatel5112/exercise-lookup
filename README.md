# exercise-lookup

## Getting Started

The [in-progress] project allows users to search exercises on given parameters:
* Exercise name
* Muscle type
* Exercise type
* Difficulty level

## Configuration

### Renaming file (REQUIRED)
* Rename sample_application.properties to application.properties

### Editing application.properties file (REQUIRED)
* You will require your own [apiKey] for the application to run. 
* Register for the [apiKey] at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/weather-by-api-ninjas/)
* After acquiring the [apiKey] add it to the application.properties file.


### Reference Documentation
Currently, the only endpoint available is '/'

### My next steps:
* Configure the API as a resource server instead of a client
* Build the frontend using ReactJS
